deplist-1.feature
=================

Originally this feature contained two more scenarios, which are not 
available in turbo version:
1. run yum instead of dnf (this depends on having yum compatible package
   installed)
   introduced by commit a9f62ed2
2. run "sh -c 'dnf repoquery --deplist TestA'" - in fact, I'm not sure
   what this test was supposed to test.
   introduced by commit cac5697e

group-2.feature
===============

Missing testing --assumeno when installing a group. Is that necessary?
