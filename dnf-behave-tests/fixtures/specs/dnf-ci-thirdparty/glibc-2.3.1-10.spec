Summary:	The GNU libc libraries

Provides:	glibc-localedata

%description
The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by
multiple programs on the system. In order to save disk space and
memory, as well as to make upgrading easier, common system code is
kept in one place and shared between programs. This particular package
contains the most important sets of shared libraries: the standard C
library and the standard math library. Without these two libraries, a
Linux system will not function.  The glibc package also contains
national language (locale) support.

Summary:	The GNU libc libraries, including support for gprof profiling

%description profile
The glibc-profile package includes the GNU libc libraries and support
for profiling using the gprof program.  Profiling is analyzing a
program's functions to see how much CPU time they use and determining
which functions are calling other functions during execution.  To use
gprof to profile a program, your program needs to use the GNU libc
libraries included in glibc-profile (instead of the standard GNU libc
libraries included in the glibc package).

If you are going to use the gprof program to profile a program, you'll
need to install the glibc-profile program.
